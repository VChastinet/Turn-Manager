**This RPG turn management system is my first attempt to make a Webapp.**
  > At my D&D sessions I observed that when the combat starts and everybody has to throw the initiative we wasted a long time organizing the result, we tryed many strategies to make this part more eficient but it was never optmal.
  > Then i started studying web development and used this problem to make this web app and practice a little of what i learned.
  >there's still some bugs and organizational problems and many other features that i'll try to implement. It's a work in progress and a playground to practice some programing.
  
  **For this project i used [Jquery](https://jquery.com/) and [MaterializeCSS](http://materializecss.com/)**

# Features!
  - It has a validation system, so all additions must have a type, bosses and player must have a name.

  - It's has many types to organize the combat so i'ts clear who's who on the board.

  - You can also change the status of a character, for now it can only be uncoscious.
